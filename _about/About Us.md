# Singapore Government Partnerships Office

As Singapore faces more complex challenges in a world that is increasingly divided, all of us have a role to play in steering the countryâ€™s future. For a more mature and inclusive Singapore society, building trust and care between citizens, the government and other sectors is paramount.

To achieve this, the Singapore Government Partnerships Office (SGPO) was officially launched in October 2023, following the [Final Report of the Forward Singapore exercise](https://www.forwardsingapore.gov.sg). Our mission is to help you partner with government and others to shape a better Singapore. 

SGPO:
* Serves as a first-stop for citizens and others keen on partnerships, by identifying opportunities for collaboration. We connect stakeholders and resources to help turn ideas into action.

* Brings people together to share knowledge, expertise and best practices.

* Shares stories on inspiring changemakers so more will step forward to serve their communities.
