# Singapore Government Partnerships Office
Singapore faces more complex challenges, and all of us can play a part in shaping our country's future. As Singapore society matures and becomes more diverse, building shared goals and mutual trust between citizens and the government is paramount. 

To support this effort, the Singapore Government Partnerships Office (SGPO) is officially announced in October 2023, as part of the [Final Report of the Forward Singapore exercise](https://www.forwardsingapore.gov.sg). Our mission is to help you partner with government and others to shape a better Singapore. 

SGPO:
* Serves as a first-stop for citizens and others keen on partnerships, by identifying opportunities for collaboration. We connect stakeholders and resources to help turn ideas into action.

* Brings people together to share knowledge, expertise and best practices on effective partnerships.

* Shares stories on inspiring changemakers, to encourage more to step forward and contribute.
