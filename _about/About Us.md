# Singapore Government Partnerships Office

As Singapore faces more complex challenges in a world that is increasingly divided, our ambition is to grow citizens’ joint ownership in steering the country’s future. For a more mature and inclusive Singapore society, we want to build trust and care between citizens, the government and other sectors that make up the tapestry of our lives.

To achieve this, the Singapore Government Partnerships Office (SGPO) was officially launched in October 2023 following the Final Report of the Forward Singapore exercise.

SGPO sets out to:
* **Catalyse partnerships:** We serve as a first-stop for citizens and others keen on partnerships, by identifying opportunities for collaboration and connecting them with people and resources to help turn their ideas into action.

* **Grow thought and practice leadership in partnerships and engagement:** We bring people together to share knowledge, expertise and best practices.

* **Drive public awareness and inspire action:** We tell stories on the most inspiring changemakers so more will step forward to serve their communities.
