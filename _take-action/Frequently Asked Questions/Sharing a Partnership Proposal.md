### 1. How do I get started? 

Explore the [Partners Portal](/take-action/partnersportal/) page on the SGPO website for resources that may support your idea e.g, community funds, volunteer opportunities. If none of these are relevant, you are welcome to share a partnership proposal here.

### 2. What is a partnership proposal? 

We describe a partnership proposal as an idea that you would like to take action on, that can benefit the community and may require support from the Government. 

This support may include:

1. connections to networks, organisations, volunteers or expertise
2. being connected to or co-developing events (e.g. challenges and hackathons),
3. receiving training (e.g. in design thinking), 
4. sourcing for venues; and/or
5. funding. 

Partnership proposals should **not**: 

1. be mainly-for-profit, 
2. be about complaints/feedback; and
3. have no proposed action. 

Explore this website to discover which platforms best meet your needs.  

### 3. Can the partnership proposal also be a grant application? 

Submitting a partnership proposal does not directly qualify you for grants. However, once you are linked with the respective government agencies, you may then work with them to separately apply for grant where needed. 

If you are **only** interested in applying for grants, please visit [OurSG Grants portal](https://oursggrants.gov.sg).  

### 4. Why is SingPass login required to fill up the partnership proposal?

SingPass log-in is used purely to authenticate your identity. 

### 5. What if I want to share my partnership proposal in another format rather than written text? 

You are welcome to submit additional information in various formats. If you wish to submit a video proposal, you may do so by uploading a word document with a link to your video. Do note that you would still need to fill in the form's mandatory submission fields. 

### 6. What happens after I submit my partnership proposal? Why does it to take up to 3-4 weeks for agencies to respond to my partnership proposal? What happens if I do not hear back from anyone?

All partnership proposals developed are taken seriously by the respective Government agencies. Complex proposals will require more time for agencies to assess their feasibility. Hence, adequate time is needed for agencies to get back to citizens with a meaningful response.

You may write in to the [Singapore Government Partnerships Office](/contact-us/) if you do not hear back on your proposal after 3 - 4 weeks.
