## 1. How do I get started? 

Explore the [Partners Portal](https://www.sg/take-action/partnersportal/) page on the SGPO website for existing resources that support your idea e.g., community funds, volunteer opportunities. If none of these adequately support your idea, you are welcome to submit a [partnership proposal](https://go.gov.sg/takeactiontoday). 

## 2. What is a partnership proposal? 

In SGPO's context, a partnership proposal is an idea that you would like to take action that can benefit the community and may require support from the Government. 

This support may take various forms such as:

1. connections to specific networks, organisations, volunteers or expertise
2. being connected to or co-developing events (e.g. challenges and hackathons),
3. receiving training (e.g. in design thinking), 
4. sourcing for venues and/or
5. funding. 

Partnership proposals should **not be**: 

1. mainly-for-profit, 
2. about complaints/feedback and
3. have no proposed action. 

Explore the SGPO website to see if there are other platforms more aligned with your needs. 

## 3. Can the partnership proposal also be a grant application? 

Submission of a partnership proposal does not directly qualify you for grants. However, once linked up with the respective government agencies, you may then work with them to separately apply for grant where needed. 

If you are **only** interested in applying for grants, please visit [OurSG Grants Portal](www.oursggrants.gov.sg). 

## 4. Why is SingPass login required to fill up the partnership proposal? Why is my personal information not auto-filled despite the use of SingPass? 

SingPass log-in is used purely to authenticate your identity. Your personal information is hence not used to pre-fill the submission fields. 

## 5. What if I want to submit partnership proposal in another format rather than written text? 

You are welcome to submit additional information in various formats. Should you wish to submit a video proposal, you may do so by uploading a word document with a link to your video. Do note that you would still need to fill in the form's mandatory submission fields. 

## 6. What happens after I submit my partnership proposal? Why must I wait up to 3-4 weeks for agencies to respond to my partnership proposal? 

To galvanise efforts in partnering citizens to shape a better Singapore, the SGPO is established to take the lead in engaging and partnering Singaporeans. The office will facilitate interactions between contributing citizens and the relevant government agencies, and strengthen partnerships to shape a better Singapore. 

All partnership proposals developed are taken seriously by the respective Government agencies. Complex proposals will require more time for agencies to assess their feasibility. Hence, adequate time is needed for agencies to get back to citizens with a meaningful response.
