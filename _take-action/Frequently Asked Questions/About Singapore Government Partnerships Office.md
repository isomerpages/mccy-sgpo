## 1. Why is there a need for the Singapore Government Partnerships Office, and what does it do? 

As Singapore faces more complex challenges, all of us can play a part in shaping our country's future. As Singapore society matures and becomes more diverse, building shared goals and mutual trust between citizens and the government is paramount. 

Singaporeans also want to contribute to issues close to their heart. The Government welcomes this and is committed to supporting more ground-up efforts by Singaporeans to shape and improve their communities.

## 2. How can I partner the government for the public good through this website. 

The SGPO website is a first-stop platform for Singaporeans who want to partner with the Government and others, to act on ideas that contribute to the public good. The website helps connect them with relevant agencies and resources. Click on the [Partners Portal](https://www.sg/take-action/partnersportal/) page on the website for more details. 

## 3. How does the SGPO website differ from existing platforms like REACH? 

[REACH](https://www.reach.gov.sg/) is the lead agency in facilitating whole-of-government efforts to engage and connect with Singaporeans on national and social issues close to their hearts, Its main functions are to gauge ground sentiments, engage citizens for feedback, and facilitate public consultation exercises. 

SGPO's mission is to help citizens partner with government and others to shape a better Singapore.
