the government is paramount.</p>
<p>Singaporeans also want to contribute to issues close to their heart. The
Government welcomes this and is committed to supporting more ground-up

<h3>2. How does this website help me to partner the government for the public good?</h3>
<p>The SGPO website is a first-stop platform. If you want to act on ideas
that contribute to the public good, this website will help inform and connect
you with relevant agencies and resources. Please click on the <a href="/take-action/partnersportal/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Partners Portal</a> page

<h3>3. How does the SGPO website differ from existing platforms like REACH?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.reach.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">REACH</a> is
the lead agency in facilitating whole-of-government efforts to engage and
connect with you on national and social issues close to your hearts. Its
key roles are to gauge ground sentiments, engage citizens for feedback,
and promote active citizenry through public consultation.</p>
<p>SGPO's mission complements this by supporting those who want to take action
on issues they care about, through partnership with the Government.</p>
