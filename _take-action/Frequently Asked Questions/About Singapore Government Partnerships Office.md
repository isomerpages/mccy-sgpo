### 1. Why is there a need for the Singapore Government Partnerships Office, and what does it do? 

Singapore faces complex challenges, and all of us can play a part in addressing them, and shaping our nation's future. As our society matures and becomes more diverse, building shared goals and mutual trust between citizens and the government is paramount. 

Singaporeans also want to contribute to issues close to their heart. The Government welcomes this and is committed to supporting more ground-up efforts by Singaporeans to shape and improve their communities.

The Singapore Government Partnerships Office (SGPO) was officially launched by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong on 19 Jan 2024 to strengthen the government's partnerships and engagements with citizens. The new office is a response to aspirations shared by citizens during the [Forward Singapore](http://www.forwardsingapore.gov.sg) exercise to shape their communities, as well as co-create policies, public spaces and services.

### 2. How does this website help me to partner the government for the public good? 

The SGPO website is a first-stop platform. If you want to act on ideas that contribute to the public good, this website will help inform and connect you with relevant agencies and resources. Please click on the [Partners Portal](/take-action/partnersportal/) page for more details. 

### 3. How does the SGPO website differ from existing platforms like REACH? 

[REACH](https://www.reach.gov.sg/) is the lead agency in facilitating whole-of-government efforts to engage and connect with you on national and social issues close to your hearts. Its key roles are to gauge ground sentiments, engage citizens for feedback, and promote active citizenry through public consultation. 

SGPO's mission complements this by supporting those who want to take action on issues they care about, through partnership with the Government.
