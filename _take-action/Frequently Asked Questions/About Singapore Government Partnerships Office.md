## 1. Why is there a need for the Singapore Government Partnerships Office, and what does it do? 

As Singapore faces more complex challenges, all of us can play a part in shaping our country's future. As Singapore society matures and becomes more diverse, building shared goals and mutual trust between citizens and the government is paramount. 

Singaporeans also want to contribute to issues close to their heart. The Government welcomes this and is committed to supporting more ground-up efforts by Singaporeans to shape and improve their communities.
