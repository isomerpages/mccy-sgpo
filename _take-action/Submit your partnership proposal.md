We welcome ideas and proposals that contribute to the public good of Singapore.

Currently, our focus is on

* Arts, culture, and heritage
* Community building
* Education
* Placemaking
* Preventive Health

If you have an idea for a potential partnership that relates to these issues, we would love to hear from you. If your proposal is on other issues, youâ€™re welcome to share it too, but do give us more time to respond. Read on to find out how you can do so!
