Before submitting your partnership ideas, there are several key pieces of information that you should have on hand to ensure that your proposal is as strong as possible. Here is a checklist of the information we recommend having before submitting your partnership idea:

1.   Your organization's name, mission, and values
2.   A brief summary of your organization's strengths and areas of expertise
3.   A clear description of the proposed partnership and how it aligns with our values and mission
4.   An outline of the expected outcomes and benefits of the partnership for both organizations
5.   Details on the resources, funding, and personnel required to implement the partnership
6.   Any relevant timelines or deadlines for the partnership
7.   Contact information for your organization, including the name and email address of the primary point of contact

Having this information on hand will help us to better evaluate your partnership idea and determine whether it is a good fit for our organization. We encourage you to review this checklist before submitting your proposal and to ensure that all necessary information is included. Thank you for considering a partnership with us, and we look forward to reviewing your proposal.
