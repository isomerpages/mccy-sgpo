<h2><strong>Have an idea for a better Singapore?</strong></h2>
<p>Citizen ideas and actions can make a big difference in the lives of other
Singaporeans!</p>
<p>But how can these ideas be further developed to help the people or causes
we want to help? What support is available? What are possible next steps?</p>
<p>Join the Citizens’ Circles to get more information and feedback on your
idea. You will also get the opportunity to connect and collaborate with
other citizens. Together, we can make Singapore better!
